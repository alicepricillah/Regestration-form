## 🧱 CSS Techniques Applied
- Layout centering using Flexbox  
- Responsive design using `max-width` and percentage-based widths  
- Consistent spacing using `margin` and `padding`  
- Smooth hover and focus transitions  
- Rounded input fields using `border-radius`  
- Shadow effects for depth using `box-shadow`

- Input fields have full width for better usability.  
- Hover and focus states help users know where they are typing.  
- The color palette provides good contrast and accessibility.
